欢迎来到游戏4。您将与 {{session.num_participants}}名玩家随机匿名匹配，组成本游戏的一个固定小组。
</p>

<p>
You will start with an endowment of {{Constants.endowment}} points. You can keep the 10 points, or contribute any number of them to a public good. Any points that you contribute are multiplied by {{Constants.multiplier}} with the result divided equally between all of the players.
</p>

<p>
If all of the players keep their endowment (contributing 0 points to the public good), everyone will end up with {{Constants.endowment}} points. 
</p>

<p>
If all of the players contribute the full {{Constants.endowment}} points to the public good, everyone will end up with {{maximum_score}} points.
