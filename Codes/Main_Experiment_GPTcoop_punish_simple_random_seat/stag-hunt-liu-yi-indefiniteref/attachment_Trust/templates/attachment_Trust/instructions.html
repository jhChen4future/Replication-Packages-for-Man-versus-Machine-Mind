        This is <span style="color:red"><i><b>Part 2</b></i></span> of the experiment.
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
        One of you will be selected at random to be <span style="color:blue">participant A</span>;
        the other will be <span style="color:green">participant B</span>.
        You will learn whether you are participant A or B prior to making any
        decision.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start, participant A receives {{ Constants.endowment }};
        participant B receives
        nothing.
        Participant A can send <strong>none, some or all of
        her {{ Constants.endowment }}</strong> to participant B.
        Before B receives this amount, it will be <span style="color:red"><strong>multiplied
        by {{ Constants.multiplier }}</strong></span>. Once B receives
        the tripled amount, she can decide to send <strong>none, some or all of it</strong> to
        A.
