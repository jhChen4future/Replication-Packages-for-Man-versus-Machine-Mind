            This is <span style="color:red">Part 3 (the last part)</span> of the experiment.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
        In this part, you will be assigned as either Proposer or Responder and then make decisions described as below.<br><br>

        There will be $10.00 for a proposer to decide how much she keeps and how much she wants to send to her partner. Once the proposer makes the offer,
       <strong>the responder can either accept it or reject it.</strong>
        <p>If the responder chooses to accept it, the monetary allocation happens and they split the money as proposer decided. However, if the responder decides to reject the offer,
        the proposal fails and both proposer and responder will receive $0.00 and the $10.00 will vanish away.</p>
