            This is <span style="color:red">Part 3 (the last part)</span> of the experiment.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">
        In this part, you will be assigned as either Proposer or Responder and then make decisions described as below.<br><br>

        There will be $10.00 for a proposer to decide how much she keeps and how much she wants to send to her partner. Once the proposer makes the offer,
       <strong>the responder can either accept it or reject it.</strong>
        <p>If the responder chooses to accept it, the monetary allocation happens and they split the money as proposer decided. However, if the responder decides to reject the offer,
        the proposal fails and both proposer and responder will receive $0.00 and the $10.00 will vanish away.</p>
        <p>In the next part, You will make decisions as <strong>both proposer and responder</strong> before you know your roles, and the system will randomly decides your role, then exercise
            your decision. The questions you will be asked are below:
        <br>
        </p>
            <p>
            If you are chosen as the  <strong>provider</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
            You need to make the decision of how you want to allocate the $10.00 between you and your partner and wait until your partner to make a decision of either to accept the offer or reject it.
    </p>
            <p>
        If you are chosen as the <strong>responder</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
            You will need to check the offer your partner sends you. What is the minimum amount of money you will need to accept this offer (that means, if the provider offers less than this money, you will reject the offer)?
